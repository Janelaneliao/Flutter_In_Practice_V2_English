# 1.3 Setting up Flutter Development Environment

To do good work, one must first sharpen one's tools. This section will first introduce the installation of Flutter SDK on Windows and macOS separately, and then explain the use of IDE and simulator.

## 1.3.1 Installing Flutter

Since Flutter builds and releases packages for both the Android and iOS platforms, it depends on both Android SDK and iOS SDK. Therefore, when installing Flutter, one also needs to install the corresponding platform's build tools and SDK. We will now introduce the environment setup for Windows and macOS.

> Note: The installation methods presented in this section may change as Flutter is updated. If the information provided below is no longer valid at the time of your Flutter installation, please visit the official Flutter website and follow the latest installation instructions.

### 1. Using Mirrors

As accessing Flutter in China may be restricted at times, the Flutter team has set up temporary mirrors for Chinese developers. To utilize these mirrors, add the following environment variables to your user environment:

```
export PUB_HOSTED_URL=https://pub.flutter-io.cn
export FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL=https://storage.flutter-io.cn
```

**Note:** These mirrors are temporary and may not always be available. Readers can refer to https://flutter.dev/community/china for the latest updates on mirror servers.

### 2. Setting up Flutter Development Environment on Windows

#### 1) System Requirements

To install and run Flutter, your development environment must meet the following minimum requirements:

- Operating System: Windows 7 or higher (64-bit)
- Disk Space: 400 MB (excluding the disk space required for Android Studio)
- Tools: Flutter depends on the following command line tools:
  * [PowerShell 5.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-windows-powershell#upgrading-existing-windows-powershell) or a newer version
  * [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (Git command line tool)

  If Git for Windows is already installed, ensure that the `git` command can be run in the command prompt or PowerShell.

#### 2) Getting Flutter SDK

1. Download the latest available installation package for Flutter from the official website at: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/sdk/releases.

   Note that Flutter's release versions may change frequently. For users located in Mainland China, gaining access to the list of installation packages or downloading the packages may require circumventing restrictions. Readers can also download the installation package from the Flutter GitHub project at: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/releases.

2. Unzip the installation package to the desired location for installing Flutter SDK (e.g., `C:\src\flutter`). **Note:** Do not install Flutter in directories requiring elevated permissions, such as `C:\Program Files\`.

3. In the `flutter` directory within the Flutter installation directory, locate `flutter_console.bat`, double-click to run it, and start the **Flutter command line**. You can then run Flutter commands through the Flutter command line.

##### Updating Environment Variables

If you want to run Flutter commands in the Windows system's built-in command line, add the following environment variables to your user PATH:

- In the start menu's search function, type "env", then select "Edit the system environment variables".
- Under "User variables", check if there is an entry named "Path":
  * If the entry exists, append the full path of `flutter\bin` using `;` as the delimiter.
  * If the entry does not exist, create a new User variable named `Path`, and set the full path of `flutter\bin` as its value.

Restart Windows to apply this change.

##### Running the `flutter doctor` Command

Run the following command in the Flutter command line to check if any additional dependencies need to be installed:

```shell
flutter doctor
```

This command checks your environment and displays a report in the command line window. The Dart SDK is already bundled with the Flutter SDK, so there is no need to install Dart separately. Carefully review the command line output for any other software that may need to be installed or further tasks that need to be performed.

For example:

```bash
[-] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices
    • Android SDK at D:\Android\sdk
    ✗ Android SDK is missing command line tools; download from https://goo.gl/XxQghQ
    • Try re-installing or updating your Android SDK,
      visit https://flutter.dev/setup/#android-setup for detailed instructions.
```

When running the flutter command for the first time (e.g., `flutter doctor`), it will download its dependencies and compile them. Subsequent runs will be much faster. Install any missing dependencies and then re-run the `flutter doctor` command to verify the successful installation.

#### 3) Android Setup

Flutter relies on a full installation of Android Studio. Android Studio not only manages Android platform dependencies and SDK versions, but it is also one of the recommended IDEs for Flutter development (of course, you can also use other editors or IDEs, which we will discuss later).

##### Installing Android Studio

1. Download and install Android Studio from: https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html.
2. Launch Android Studio and follow the "Android Studio Setup Wizard". This will install the latest Android SDK, Android SDK Platform Tools, and Android SDK Build Tools, which are required for Android development with Flutter.

#### 4) Encountering Installation Issues?

If you encounter any problems during the installation process, you can first go to the flutter official website to see if there have been any changes to the installation method, or search for solutions online.

### 3. Setting up Flutter Development Environment on macOS

Testing on both Android and iOS devices is possible on macOS.

#### 1) System Requirements

To install and run Flutter, your development environment must meet the following minimum requirements:

- Operating System: macOS (64-bit)
- Disk Space: 700 MB (excluding Xcode or Android Studio disk space).
- Tools: Flutter depends on the following command-line tools.
  * `bash, mkdir, rm, git, curl, unzip, which`

#### 2) Getting Flutter SDK

1. Download the latest available installation package from the flutter official website, official website address: https://flutter.dev/sdk-archive/#macos.

   Note that the channel version of Flutter may change constantly, please refer to the Flutter official website for the latest information. In addition, in mainland China, in order to obtain the package list or download the installation package normally, you may need to use a VPN. Readers can also go to the Flutter github project to download the installation package, address: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/releases.

2. Unzip the installation package to the directory where you want to install it, for example:

   ```shell
   cd ~/development
   unzip ~/Downloads/flutter_macos_v0.5.1-beta.zip
   ```

3. Add flutter-related tools to the path:

   ```shell
   export PATH=`pwd`/flutter/bin:$PATH
   ```

   This code can only temporarily set the PATH environment variable for the current command line window. To permanently add Flutter to the PATH, please refer to the **Update Environment Variables** section below.

##### Run the `flutter doctor` command

This step is the same as in Windows and will not be repeated here.

##### Update Environment Variables

Adding Flutter to the PATH allows you to run the `flutter` command in any terminal session.

The steps to permanently modify this variable for all terminal sessions will depend on the specific computer system. Typically, you would add the commands to set the environment variables to a file that is executed when a new window is opened. For example,

1. Determine the directory of your Flutter SDK, and we will refer to it as "FLUTTER_INSTALL_PATH" in the following configuration.

2. Open (or create) `$HOME/.bash_profile`. The file path and file name may be different on your computer.

3. Add the following path:

   ```shell
   export PATH=[FLUTTER_INSTALL_PATH]/flutter/bin:$PATH
   ```
   For example, if the author's Flutter installation directory is "~/code/flutter_dir", the code would be:

   ```
   export PATH=~/code/flutter_dir/flutter/bin:$PATH
   ```

4. Run `source $HOME/.bash_profile` to refresh the current terminal window.

   > **Note:** If you are using the zsh terminal, the `~/.bash_profile` will not be loaded when the terminal starts. The solution is to modify `~/.zshrc` and add the following: source ～/.bash_profile

5. Verify if "flutter/bin" is already in the PATH:

   ```
   echo $PATH
   ```



#### 3) Installing Xcode

To develop Flutter applications for iOS, you need the latest version of Xcode:

1. Install the latest version of Xcode.
2. Configure the Xcode command-line tools to use the newly installed Xcode version with `sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`. For most cases, this is the correct path when you want to use the latest version of Xcode. If you need to use a different version, specify the appropriate path.
3. Make sure to agree to the Xcode license agreement by either opening Xcode once or using the command `sudo xcodebuild -license`.

Using Xcode, you can run Flutter applications on iOS devices or simulators.

#### 4) Installing Android Studio

Just like on Windows, to build and run Flutter programs on Android devices, you need to first install Android Studio. Readers can download and install Android Studio on their own, so it will not be elaborated here.

### 4. Upgrading Flutter

#### 1) Flutter SDK Branch

Flutter SDK has multiple branches, such as beta, dev, master, and stable, where the stable branch is the stable branch (in the future, there may be new stable branches released after stable versions, such as 1.0.0), and dev and master are development branches. After installing Flutter, you can run `flutter channel` to view all branches. After running locally, the author's result is as follows:

```
Flutter channels:
  beta
  dev
* master
```

The branch marked with "*" is the branch tracked by your local Flutter SDK. To switch branches, you can use `flutter channel beta` or `flutter channel master`. Flutter officially recommends tracking the stable branch, but you can also track the `master` branch, which allows you to see the latest changes, but this will result in much lower stability.

#### 2) Upgrading Flutter SDK and Dependencies

To upgrade the flutter SDK, just use a single command:

```shell
flutter upgrade
```

This command will update both the Flutter SDK and the dependencies of your Flutter project. If you only want to update the project dependencies (excluding the Flutter SDK), you can use the following commands:

- `flutter packages get` to get all the project dependencies.
- `flutter packages upgrade` to get the latest versions of all project dependencies.



## 1.3.2 IDE Configuration and Usage

In theory, you can use any text editor and command-line tools to build Flutter applications. However, Flutter officially recommends using either Android Studio or VS Code for a better development experience. The official Flutter team provides plugins for these two editors, which offer features such as code completion, syntax highlighting, widget editing assistance, and support for running and debugging, all of which can greatly improve development efficiency. Below, we will introduce the configuration and usage of Android Studio and VS Code separately (readers of Android Studio and VS Code can obtain the latest installations from their official websites, and due to the simplicity of the installations, we will not delve into them).

### 1. Configuration and Usage of Android Studio

As Android Studio is based on IntelliJ IDEA, readers can also use IntelliJ IDEA.

#### 1) Installing Flutter and Dart Plugins

You need to install two plugins:

- `Flutter` plugin: Supports the Flutter development workflow (running, debugging, hot reload, etc.).
- `Dart` plugin: Provides code analysis (verification and code completion while typing).

Installation steps:

1. Start Android Studio.
2. Open the plugin preferences (macOS: **Preferences>Plugins**, Windows: **File>Settings>Plugins**).
3. Select **Browse repositories…**, choose the flutter plugin, and click `install`.
4. After restarting Android Studio, the plugins will take effect.

Next, let's use Android Studio to create a Flutter project, run it, and experience "hot reload."

#### 2) Creating a Flutter Application

1. Choose **File>New Flutter Project**.
2. Choose **Flutter application** as the project type, then click Next.
3. Enter the project name (e.g., `myapp`), then click Next.
4. Click **Finish**.
5. Wait for Android Studio to install the SDK and create the project.

The above commands create a Flutter project named myapp, which includes a simple demo application using [Material components](https://material.io/guidelines/).

In the project directory, your application code is located at `lib/main.dart`.

#### 3) Running the Application

1. Locate the Android Studio toolbar, as shown in Figures 1-2:

   ![image-20240129231843614](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JedLee6/PublicPicBed/main/uPic/image-20240129231843614.png)

2. In the **target selector**, choose an Android device to run the application. If none are listed, choose **Tools>Android>AVD Manager** and create one there.

3. Click the **Run icon** in the toolbar.

4. If everything is normal, you should see the launched application on your device or emulator, as shown in Figure 1-3:

   ![image-20240129231736962](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JedLee6/PublicPicBed/main/uPic/image-20240129231736962.png)


#### 4) Experiencing Hot Reload

Flutter allows for rapid development cycles through *hot reload*, which means you can load modified code in real time without restarting the application and without losing its state. Simply make changes to the code, then tell the IDE or command-line tool that you need to reload (click the reload button), and you will see the changes on your device or emulator.

1. Open the `lib/main.dart` file
2. Change the string
   `'You have pushed the button this many times:'` to
   `'You have clicked the button this many times:'`
3. Do not press the "Stop" button; let your application continue running.
4. To apply the changes, call **Save** (`cmd-s` / `ctrl-s`), or click the **hot reload button** (the button with a lightning⚡️ icon).

   You will immediately see the updated string in the running application.


### 2. Configuration and Usage of VS Code

VS Code is a lightweight editor that supports Flutter running and debugging.

#### 1) Installing the Flutter Plugin

1. Launch VS Code.
2. Invoke **View>Command Palette…**.
3. Input 'install', then choose the **Extensions: Install Extension** action.
4. In the search box, type `flutter`, select 'Flutter' in the search results list, then click **Install**.
5. Choose 'OK' to restart VS Code.
6. Verify the configuration
   * Invoke **View>Command Palette…**
   * Input 'doctor', then choose **'Flutter: Run Flutter Doctor'** action.
   * Check for any issues in the output within the "OUTPUT" window.

#### 2) Creating a Flutter Application

1. Launch VS Code.
2. Invoke **View>Command Palette…**.
3. Input 'flutter', then choose **'Flutter: New Project'** action.
4. Enter the project name (e.g., `myapp`) and press enter.
5. Specify the location for the project, then press the blue accept button.
6. Wait for the project creation to continue and display the main.dart file.

#### 3) Experiencing Hot Reload1. Open the `lib/main.dart` file.
2. Change the string `'You have pushed the button this many times:'` to `'You have clicked the button this many times:'`.
3. Do not press the "Stop" button; let your application continue running.
4. To see your changes, simply save (`cmd+s` / `ctrl+s`), or click the **hot reload button** (green circular arrow button).

You will immediately see the updated string in the running application.

## 1.3.3 Connect device to run Flutter apps

On Windows, only building and running Flutter apps for Android devices is supported, while macOS supports both iOS and Android devices. Below are instructions for connecting Android and iOS devices to run Flutter apps.

### 1. Connect Android Emulator

To prepare for running and testing Flutter apps on an Android emulator, follow these steps:

1. Launch **Android Studio>Tools>Android>AVD Manager** and select **Create Virtual Device**.
   
2. Choose a device and select **Next**.

3. Select one or more system images for the Android version to be simulated, then choose **Next**. It is recommended to use an *x86* or *x86_64* image.

4. Under "Emulated Performance", select **Hardware - GLES 2.0** for enabling [hardware acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration.html).

5. Verify that the AVD configuration is correct, then choose **Finish**.

   For more detailed information on the above steps, see [Managing AVDs](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html).

6. In "Android Virtual Device Manager", click **Run** on the toolbar. The emulator starts and displays the boot screen for the selected OS version or device.

7. Run `flutter run` to start your device. The connected device will be named `Android SDK built for <platform>`, where *platform* is the chipset series, such as x86.

### 2. Connect Android physical device

To prepare for running and testing Flutter apps on an Android device, you will need an Android device with Android 4.1 (API level 16) or higher.

1. Enable **Developer Options** and **USB Debugging** on the Android device. Detailed instructions can be found in the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options.html).

2. Connect the phone to the computer using a USB cable. If the device prompts for debug authorization, grant permission for your computer to access the device.

3. Run the `flutter devices` command in the terminal to verify that Flutter recognizes the connected Android device.

4. Run `flutter run` to start the app.

By default, Flutter uses the version of the Android SDK based on your `adb` tool version. If you want Flutter to use a different version of the Android SDK, you must set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the corresponding SDK installation directory.

### 3. Connect iOS Simulator

To prepare for running and testing Flutter apps on an iOS simulator, follow these steps:

1. On your Mac, find the simulator through Spotlight or with the following command:

	```shell
open -a Simulator
	```

2. Ensure that the simulator is using a 64-bit device (iPhone 5s or later) by checking the settings in the **Hardware>Device** menu.

3. Depending on your computer screen size, the high-resolution iOS simulator device may overflow the screen. You can set the device scale in the simulator's **Window>Scale** menu.

4. Run `flutter run` to start the Flutter app.

### 4. Connect iOS physical device

To install a Flutter app on an iOS physical device, you will need some additional tools, an Apple account, and some setup in Xcode.

1. Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (skip this step if brew is already installed).

2. Open Terminal and run the following commands:

	```shell
   brew update
   brew install --HEAD libimobiledevice
   brew install ideviceinstaller ios-deploy cocoapods
   pod setup
	```

   If any of the commands fail and show errors, run `brew doctor` and follow the instructions to resolve the issue.

3. Follow the Xcode signing process to configure your project:

   * Open the default Xcode workspace in your Flutter project directory by using `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`.

   * In Xcode, select the `Runner` project in the left pane of the navigation panel.

   * In the `Runner` target settings page, ensure that your development team is selected under **General > Signing > Team**. When you select a team, Xcode will create and download the development certificate, register your account with your device, and create and download provisioning profiles if necessary.

   * To start your first iOS development project, you may need to sign in to Xcode with your Apple ID, as shown in the following figure 1-4:

     ![image-20240129231919320](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JedLee6/PublicPicBed/main/uPic/image-20240129231919320.png)

     Any Apple ID supports development and testing, but if you want to distribute the app to the App Store, you must register for the Apple Developer Program. For more details, readers can find out on their own.

   4. When you attach a physical iOS device for iOS development the first time, you need to trust both your Mac and the development certificate on the device. When connecting the iOS device to the Mac for the first time, choose `Trust` in the dialog box, as shown in figure 1-5:

      ![image-20240129231941486](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JedLee6/PublicPicBed/main/uPic/image-20240129231941486.png)
      
      Then, go to the **Settings** menu on your iOS device, select **General > Device Management** and trust your certificate.

5. If automatic signing in Xcode fails, verify that the **General > Identity > Bundle Identifier** value of the project is unique, as shown in Figure 1-6:

   ![image-20240129231953081](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JedLee6/PublicPicBed/main/uPic/image-20240129231953081.png)

6. Run `flutter run` to launch the flutter application.

## 1.3.4 Common Configuration Issues

### 1. Android Studio Issues

#### 1) Missing Dependency Library Issue

One of the most common issues encountered when starting with Android is the error shown in Figure 1-7. Clicking the hyperlink at this point will automatically redirect you to the installation page.

![image-20240129232009163](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JedLee6/PublicPicBed/main/uPic/image-20240129232009163.png)

After installing, re-run as shown in Figure 1-8:

![image-20240129232018342](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JedLee6/PublicPicBed/main/uPic/image-20240129232018342.png)

#### 2) Unable to Connect to Android Repository

This is also one of the most common issues. When you find that you are unable to download some dependencies, this circumstance should be given priority. Enter `File` -> `Settings` -> `Appearance & Behavior` -> `System Settings` -> `Android SDK` -> `SDK Update Sites` list, where you may see that the `Android Repository` cannot be connected, as shown in Figure 1-9:

![image-20240129232049699](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JedLee6/PublicPicBed/main/uPic/image-20240129232049699.png)

This is because you need to download the Android SDK from Google, but it is currently not accessible in China. Therefore, you can configure a proxy or use a VPN.

#### 3) Android Package Configuration Issues

Typically in the format

```
Could not HEAD **
Could not Get **
```

For example: `Android Studio Could not GET gradle-3.2.0.pom`

These problems are caused by the inability to connect to the Maven repository, and the solution is as follows:

1. Navigate to `YourProjectName/android`

2. Open `build.gradle`

3. Find the following section and add `maven { url 'http://maven.aliyun.com/nexus/content/groups/public/' }` 

	```groovy
   allprojects {
       repositories {
         google()
         jcenter()
         maven { url 'http://maven.aliyun.com/nexus/content/groups/public/' } // Add this line
   	}
   }
	```

4. Go to File/ Settings/ Build, Execution, Deployment/ BuildTools/ Gradle/ Android Studio, check Enable embedded Maven repository, and restart Android Studio to solve the issue.

   > **Note:** In a situation where, despite following the above steps, you are still unable to resolve the problem and encounter reports similar to `Could not HEAD maven.aliyun.com`, please check if a proxy is set in `C:\Users\{user_name}\.gradle\gradle.properties`. Deleting it can resolve the problem.

#### 4) Hot Reload Failure Issue

After setting up a proxy for a terminal emulator such as `Terminal`, the "Hot Reload" function will fail, and using **Save** (`cmd-s` / `ctrl-s`) will not trigger a hot reload, and the **hot reload button** (with a ⚡️ icon) will not be displayed. Removing the proxy will solve this issue.

In addition, in some cases, hot reload may not work, such as modifying the `main` function or global static methods. Readers should note that "Hot Reload" only rebuilds the entire widget tree, and if the changes are not within the process of building the widget tree, "Hot Reload" will not work. In this case, simply restart the app.
