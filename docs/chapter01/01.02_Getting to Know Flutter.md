# 1.2 Getting to Know Flutter

## 1.2.1 Introduction to Flutter

Flutter is a mobile application development framework launched and open-sourced by Google, with a focus on cross-platform, high-fidelity, and high-performance applications. Developers can use the Dart language to develop apps, with one set of code running simultaneously on both iOS and Android platforms. Flutter provides a rich set of components and interfaces, allowing developers to quickly add native extensions to Flutter. Here, we will introduce the main features of Flutter technology.

### 1. Cross-platform rendering engine

Unlike most other frameworks for building mobile applications, Flutter does not use WebView or native OS controls. Instead, Flutter uses its high-performance rendering engine to draw widgets. This ensures not only consistency in UI on Android and iOS but also avoids dependency on native controls and the associated high maintenance costs and limitations.

Flutter uses Skia as its 2D rendering engine, which is a 2D graphics library developed by Google. Skia includes efficient and concise features such as font rendering, coordinate transformations, and rasterization. Skia is cross-platform and provides a very friendly API. Currently, Google Chrome browser and Android both use Skia as their 2D graphics engine.

Flutter already supports numerous platforms such as iOS, Android, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux, and Fuchsia (Google's new self-developed operating system). However, the examples and introductions in this book mainly focus on iOS and Android platforms, and readers interested in other platforms can explore them on their own.

### 2. High performance

Flutter's high performance is mainly ensured by two factors:

Firstly, Flutter apps are developed using the Dart language. In JIT (just-in-time) mode, Dart's execution speed is comparable to JavaScript. However, Dart supports AOT (ahead-of-time) compilation, where JavaScript lags far behind in terms of execution speed. The speed improvement is especially helpful for calculating view data at high frame rates.

Secondly, Flutter uses its own rendering engine to draw UI, and layout data is directly controlled by the Dart language. Thus, unlike React Native, there is no need for communication between JavaScript and Native during the layout process. This offers a significant advantage in scenarios involving scrolling and dragging, as these actions often cause layout changes. In such cases, JavaScript would need to continuously synchronize layout information with Native. This is similar to the problems caused by frequent DOM operations in a web browser using JavaScript, leading to a considerable performance overhead.

### 3. Developed with Dart language

This is an interesting but controversial issue. Before understanding why Flutter chose Dart over JavaScript, let's first introduce two concepts mentioned earlier: JIT and AOT.

Programs mainly have two execution modes: static compilation and dynamic interpretation. Programs that are statically compiled are compiled into machine code (or intermediate bytecode) before execution, typically referred to as "AOT" (Ahead of Time). Programs that are interpreted are translated from source code to machine code in real time at runtime, typically referred to as "JIT" (Just-in-time).

AOT programs are typical of applications developed using C/C++, which must be compiled into machine code before execution. There are many representatives of JIT, such as JavaScript, Python, and others. In fact, all scripting languages support JIT mode. However, it is important to note that JIT and AOT refer to program execution modes and are not strongly associated with programming languages. Some languages can run in both JIT and AOT modes, such as Python, which can compile into intermediate bytecode on the first execution and then translate the bytecode into machine code in subsequent executions. One might say that intermediate bytecode is not machine code, and it still needs to dynamically translate bytecode into machine code during program execution, so shouldn't this be considered JIT? It is true, but the usual criterion for distinguishing AOT is whether the code needs to be compiled before execution. As long as compilation is required, regardless of whether the compilation product is bytecode or machine code, it belongs to AOT. Readers should not get caught up in the concepts; concepts are invented to convey ideas, and understanding their principles is sufficient, forgetting their form.

Now, let's see why Flutter chose the Dart language. Based on the official explanation and my own understanding of Flutter, I have summarized the following points in comparison with JavaScript (as other cross-platform frameworks use JavaScript as their development language):

1. **High development efficiency**.The combination of Dart runtime and compiler supports two key features of Flutter:

- **Fast development cycle based on JIT**: Flutter uses JIT mode in the development stage, avoiding the need for compilation with every change, greatly saving development time.

- **AOT-based release package**: Flutter can generate efficient machine code through AOT during release to ensure application performance, a capability that JavaScript lacks.

2. **High performance**:

   Flutter aims to provide a smooth and high-fidelity UI experience. To achieve this, Flutter needs to run a large amount of code in each animation frame. This requires a programming language that can guarantee high performance and no dropped frames, and Dart's AOT support allows it to perform better in this regard than JavaScript.

3. **Fast memory allocation**:

   The Flutter framework uses functional streams, making it heavily reliant on low-level memory allocation. Therefore, having an efficient memory allocator for handling trivial tasks is crucial. Without this feature, Flutter cannot work effectively. While Chrome V8's JavaScript engine is already proficient in memory allocation, many members of the Dart development team come from the Chrome team. Therefore, Dart cannot be seen as having an advantage over JavaScript in memory allocation, but for Flutter, it requires such a feature, which Dart conveniently provides.

4. **Type safety and null safety**:

   As Dart is a type-safe language and supports null safety features since version 2.12, it enables static type checking to detect some type errors before compilation and eliminate potential problems. This may be more appealing to frontend developers. In contrast, JavaScript is a weakly typed language, leading to the emergence of many extension languages and tools in the frontend community for adding static type checking to JavaScript code, such as Microsoft's TypeScript and Facebook's Flow. In comparison, Dart inherently supports static types, which is a significant advantage.

5. **The Dart team is right by your side**:

   Seemingly insignificant, yet pivotal. Due to the active involvement of the Dart team, the Flutter team can receive more convenient support. As stated on the Flutter website, "We are working closely with the Dart community to improve Dart's use in Flutter. For example, when we first adopted Dart, it did not provide a tool chain for producing native binary files, which is helpful for achieving predictable high performance, but now it does because the Dart team built it specifically for Flutter. Similarly, while the Dart VM had previously been optimized for throughput, the team is now optimizing the VM for latency, which is more important for Flutter's workloads."

#### 4. Conclusion

This section mainly introduces the characteristics of Flutter. If there are some points that are not easily understood, do not worry. With further understanding of Flutter details in the future, you will gain a deeper understanding upon revisiting.

## 1.2.2 Flutter Framework Structure

In this section, we will provide an overview of the Flutter framework, aiming to give readers a holistic impression, which is crucial for beginners. Diving directly into Flutter without a clear understanding is akin to a person in a desert without a map. Even if they find an oasis, they won't know where the next one is. Hence, regardless of the technology being learned, having a clear "map" is essential, and our learning process is to "follow the map", avoiding getting lost in details. Getting back on track, let's take a look at the Flutter framework diagram provided by the Flutter official platform, as shown in Figure 1-1:

![1-1 Flutter Framework Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JedLee6/PublicPicBed/main/uPic/1-1%20Flutter%20Framework%20Structure.png)

In brief, Flutter can be divided into three layers from top to bottom: the framework layer, the engine layer, and the embedding layer. Now let's introduce each of them:

### 1. Framework Layer

Flutter Framework, the framework layer, is an SDK implemented purely in Dart. It implements a set of foundational libraries. From the bottom up, let's provide a brief overview of this.- The lower two layers (Foundation and Animation, Painting, Gestures) are merged into a `dart UI` layer in some Google videos, corresponding to the `dart:ui` package in Flutter. It is the low-level UI library exposed by the Flutter Engine, providing animation, gestures, and drawing capabilities.

- The Rendering layer, i.e., the rendering layer, is an abstract layout layer that depends on the Dart UI layer. The rendering layer builds a **rendering tree** composed of renderable objects. When these objects are dynamically updated, the rendering tree identifies the changed parts and updates the rendering. The rendering layer is arguably the core part of the Flutter framework. In addition to determining the position and size of each rendering object, it also performs coordinate transformations and drawing (calling the underlying `dart:ui`).

- The Widgets layer is a set of basic component libraries provided by Flutter. On top of the basic component library, Flutter also provides two visual style component libraries, Material and Cupertino, which respectively implement the Material and iOS design specifications.

The Flutter framework is relatively small because some higher-level features that developers may use have been divided into different packages, implemented using Dart and Flutter's core libraries. These packages include platform plugins, such as [camera](https://pub.flutter-io.cn/packages/camera) and [webview](https://pub.flutter-io.cn/packages/webview_flutter), as well as platform-independent features, such as [animations](https://pub.flutter-io.cn/packages/animations).

Most of the time when developing with Flutter, we interact with the Flutter Framework.

### 2. Engine Layer

The Engine layer, in other words, the core of Flutter, is primarily implemented in C++. This includes the Skia engine, Dart runtime, and text layout engines. When calling the `dart:ui` library, the call ultimately goes to the engine layer, where the actual drawing and display are implemented.

### 3. Embedder Layer

The Embedder layer is essential for the final rendering and interaction of Flutter, as it relies on the operating system APIs of the platform it is on. The Embedder layer is primarily responsible for "installing" the Flutter engine on a specific platform. The Embedder layer is written in the language of the current platform, such as Java and C++ for Android, Objective-C and Objective-C++ for iOS and macOS, and C++ for Windows and Linux. Flutter code can be integrated into existing applications as modules through the Embedder layer, or it can be the main body of an application. Flutter itself includes Embedder layers for various common platforms. If Flutter is to support a new platform in the future, a new Embedder layer needs to be written for that platform.

### 4. Conclusion

In this section, we introduced the layering of the Flutter framework from top to bottom, which comprises the Framework layer, Engine layer, and Embedder layer. It is important for the reader to keep this in mind.

## 1.2.3 How to Learn Flutter

In this section, we provide some learning advice and share some insights into learning Flutter, aiming to help you improve learning efficiency.

### 1. Resources

- **Official website**: Reading the resources on the Flutter official website is the best way to get started quickly. Additionally, the official website is a place to stay updated on the latest developments in Flutter. Since Flutter is still in a rapid development stage, we recommend readers to check the official website from time to time for any new updates.

- **Source code and comments**: **Source code comments should be the first document for learning Flutter**. The source code of the Flutter SDK is included in the Flutter project, and it contains very detailed and illustrative comments. We can quickly locate the source code through the IDE's navigation feature. In fact, the official Flutter component documentation is generated from comments. According to the author's experience, combining the source code with comments can help solve most problems.

- **Github**: If the problem you encounter cannot be found on StackOverflow, you can raise an issue on the Flutter project on Github.

- **Gallery Source Code**: Gallery is the official Flutter sample app, which contains rich examples that you can download and install from the internet. The source code of Gallery is located under the `examples` directory in the Flutter source code.

- **StackOverflow**: StackOverflow is currently the largest programmer Q&A community globally, and the most active Flutter Q&A community. In addition to developers from all over the world exchanging ideas, members of the Flutter development team also frequently answer questions.

### 2. Conclusion

With resources and a community, the most important thing for learners of Flutter is to practice and get hands-on experience. In the following chapters of this book, we hope readers can try writing the examples themselves.

## 1.2.4 Summary

The Flutter framework itself has a well-designed layered structure. This section aims to give readers a general impression of the overall Flutter framework. I believe that by now readers already have an initial impression of Flutter. Before we start, we also need to understand Flutter's development language, Dart.
