## Flutter in Practice 2nd Edition, English Version

## Content introduction

This book covers not only the basic usage of Flutter, but also the design ideas and underlying principles of Flutter. The main features are as follows:

1. Based on Flutter 3.0.
2. 60% of the content has been revised and reconstructed, adding more examples and adjusting the order of some chapters to make the gradient of learning more reasonable, in order to gradually help the reader understand Flutter.
3. The further sections of Flutter provide an in-depth look at the relatively deep but important aspects of the Flutter, such as the Sliver layout protocol, rendering related layers, and the definition of components by defining RenderObject.
4. The chapter on the Core Principles of Flutter has been rewritten to include more examples to help understand the principles of Flutter's layout and rendering.
5. The book focuses more on the flutter technology itself and removes some platform-related content, such as plugin development for Android and iOS and how to develop native +flutter hybrid, which can be found on the flutter website.

The book introduces the technical principles of Flutter in a superficial and profound way. It is divided into three parts with a total of 15 chapters. The main content of each is as follows:

The first, introduction (chapters 1 to 5), covers the background and introduction of the Flutter technology, the various types of widgets, and how to build UIs with Flutter. By learning this chapter, you can learn how to use Flutter to build UI interfaces.

The second, advanced chapter (chapters 6 to 14) covers scrollable components, event mechanisms, animation, custom components, files and networks, internationalization, and the core principles of Flutter. Through this chapter, readers can gain an in-depth understanding of the structure and principle of Flutter.

The third chapter, Example (Chapter 15), threads the previous introductions through a simplified version of the Github APP to give developers an insight into the entire flow of the Flutter APP development.
